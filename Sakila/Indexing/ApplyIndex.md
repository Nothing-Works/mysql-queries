# Index

## A phone book is a very old, classic, simple and easy way to show how and `Index` works.

## An Index is an ordered representation of the indexed data.

## Example

If the `amount` is not indexed in the `payment` table.

```mysql
select * from payment
where amount = 11.99
```

It's about `40-50 ms`.

We can add `EXPLAIN` before any sql query to show how the query is executed. `type` and `rows` are two important columns to look at.(`All` and `16086` without index)

1. `type`: how the database is going to execute this query.
   - `all` means that it's going to look at all the rows, no filtering, no sorting.
2. `rows`: how many records is the database going to look at.
3. `possible_keys`: the index may be used for the query.
4. `key`: the index is used for the query.

```mysql
EXPLAIN select * from payment
where amount = 11.99
```

After applying index on `amount`, it's about `30 ms`. And `type` is `ref`, `row` is `10`

## Some types we may face:

1.  `CONST/EQ_REF`: Performs a `B-Tree` traversal to find a single value. (super fast, do not need to optimize)

    - Basically binary search.
    - This can only get used that you can guarantee the uniqueness which means only one record will be returned(FK, Unique on column).
    - `limit 1` does not mean uniqueness, you may still fetch many rows but you just pick one.

2.  `REF/RANGE`: Performs a `B-Tree` traversal to find the starting point, and then scans values from that point on. It stops if it finds a value that does not meet the criteria.

    - Also known as an index range scan.
    - It limits the total number of rows that the database needs to inspect to perform the query.
    - It's a good thing, as it's less work for the database.

3.  `Index`: Starts at the very first leaf node, scan all the leaf nodes to the end.

    - Traverses through the entire index.
    - No filtering, but still using the index.
    - Also known as a full index scan.

4.  `All`: Basically, when `type` is `all`, it's the slowest.

    - Also know as a full table scan.
    - Does not use an index at all.
    - Loads every column of every row from the table.
    - Scans through all of them and emits or discards accordingly.

## Common pitfalls

1.  `Functions`: This code below will work for the `created_at` index.

    - Solutions:

      - Use function base index if possible.(try not to use the computed column if possible.)

      - You can try to do this way: `where created_at between '2013-01-01 00:00:00' and '2013-12-31 23:59:59'`. In this way, you will have the `possible_keys` having `created_at` but the `key` is still null. You may try to use `force index (orders_created_at_idx)`. But this will make the query very very slow. This is because we are doing `sum(total)` the database needs to fetch each row to get the total and sum all(read form disk). So, **do not use force index**. Instead you need to add the total as index as well, so it does not need to read from disk any more, it's from the memory. For the `Extra` column it's `Using where; Using Index`, but it actually means that `Using Index Only` which means that `mysql` does not need to fetch from disk it can get all the results from memory, as `mysql` saves data in memory.

      - `Using Index Only` is very powerful but it's very aggressive.

```mysql
select sum(total)
from orders
where year(created_at) = '2012'
```

2. The index column order matters! So you have to use the index from left to right, you can not skip column/s. `index a and b is not the same as index b and a`.

3. Inequality Operators. As soon as you hit inequality operators the index stops there.

## This point is that there is no one index can satisfy all the queries.
